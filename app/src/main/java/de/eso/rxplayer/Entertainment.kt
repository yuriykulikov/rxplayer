 * Audio [Connection]
 *
 * An audio [Connection] represents an audio stream from a device (radio or encoder) to the physical
 * audio speaker. Each connection has a state. Only one [Connection] can be in the state other than
 * [AudioState.STOPPED] at any given moment. [Connection] state transitions have to be triggered
 * manually.
 *
 * Queueing of any kind is not implemented. A system will malfunction in case of an attempt to start
 * multiple connections simultaneously. A state of a [Connection] can be queried by calling the
 * [observe] function.
 *
 * [fadeId] and [fadeOut]
 *
 * Every connection starts at the lowest volume. Function [fadeId] has to be used to gradually fade
 * in the volume. [fadeOut] can be used to decrease the volume to zero before stopping. Only a
 * [AudioState.STARTED] can be fade in or out.
